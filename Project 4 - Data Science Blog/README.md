# Data Science Blog

**Project Motivation**

For this project, I was interestested in using 2011 - 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey data to better understand the career of data scientists. In particular, the questions I interested in are

* Does a data science role return you a happy career, or a healthier lifestyle?
* Do data scientists get paid higher salaries for working hard?
* What skills are required to become a data scientist?

**Installation**

No extra besides the built-in libraries from Anaconda needed to run this project

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* glob
* os

**File Descriptions**

* data: Folder contains data files of StackOverflow developer survey data, following name conventions of "YYYY Stack Overflow Survey Responses.csv"
* Understanding the Career of Data Scientists.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for the main analytics

**Results**

The main takeaways from this analytics are

* The best practice for doing data science is to have a question before you collect the data
* Data scientists work hard, but they are satisfied with their careers
* Versatile programming skills and strong commnunication skills are needed for data scientists

Specific findings of the code can be found at the Jupyter Notebook and blog post below.
